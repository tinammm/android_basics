# Android Development Progress
Welcome to my Android Development Progress repository! This folder contains a collection of basic Android applications that showcase my journey and progress in Android development studies.

Each application in this folder has its own README file that provides detailed information about its functions and features.

Feel free to explore the apps and their functionalities. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated!

_*Disclaimer_: For security reasons, all API keys are hidden in this repository.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
